Welcome to F4PGA examples!
==========================

This guide explains how to get started with F4PGA and build example designs from the :gh:`F4PGA Examples <chipsalliance/f4pga-examples>`
GitHub repository.
It currently focuses on the following FPGA families:

- Artix-7 and Kintex-7 from Xilinx,
- EOS S3 from QuickLogic.

Follow this guide to:

- :doc:`install F4PGA <getting>` and all of its dependencies,
- :doc:`build <building-examples>` and :doc:`upload <running-examples>`
  example designs onto the devboard of your choice.
- compile and run :doc:`your own designs<personal-designs>` using the F4PGA toolchain.
- :doc:`customize the Makefile<customizing-makefiles>` for your own designs.
- gain valuable information about :doc:`Understanding Toolchain Commands in F4PGA <understanding>`.
